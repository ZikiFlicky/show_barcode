# The show_barcode library
This is a library my CS teacher asked me and my friend to make for class as a 9th grade finish project.



# installation

### Windows and UNIX installations

For installing you can simply run the shell script `install.sh`.

If that doesnt work you should try calling it through the terminal,  

knowing the path to your python executable. 

`--python executables path-- setup.py install`
